# adventure-api
This is an adventure game played over a REST API

The idea is to give out clues (in a creative manner) on different endpoints and to create a small adventure game that leads to a treasure.

Check out the SOLUTION.md file to make sure the API makes sense to navigate to the treasure.


Don't forget to:

`````
npm install
`````

and

````
npm start
